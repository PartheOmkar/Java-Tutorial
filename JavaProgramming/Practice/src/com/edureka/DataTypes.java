/*
 * Each Variable in java has a specific type, which determines the size of memory, the range of values that 
 * can be stored and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable
 * 
 * Data type can be categorized into two major types
 * 1 > primitive
 * 2 > Non primitive
 * 
 * 1 > primitive data types :-
 * 	- the dataTypes which predefine by the language and named as a keyword
 * 	- There are 8 major Primitive DataTypes :
 *  - byte = number - 1 
 *  - short = number - 2
 *  - int = number - 4
 *  - long = number - 8
 *  - float = float number - 4
 *  - double = float number - 8
 *  - char = a character - 2
 *  - boolean = true or false - 1
 *  
 *  2 > Non-Primitive/Reference
 *  - reference variable are created using define constructors of the classes
 *  - these variables are declare to specific type that cannot be changed
 *  - object of various class strings and array come under reference dataType
